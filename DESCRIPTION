Description: EmailRep (<https://emailrep.io/>) is a system of crawlers, scanners 
    and enrichment services that collects data on email addresses, domains, and 
    internet personas. EmailRep uses hundreds of data points from social media 
    profiles, professional networking sites, dark web credential leaks, data breaches, 
    phishing kits, phishing emails, spam lists, open mail relays, domain age and 
    reputation, deliverability, and more to predict the risk of an email address.
    Tools are provided to gather reputation information for emails.
